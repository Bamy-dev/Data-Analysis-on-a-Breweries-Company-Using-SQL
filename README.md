# Data Analysis on a Breweries Company Using SQL
 Showing how SQL can be used to extract data and find answers.

I will be carrying out the following analyses to aid better decision making in order to maximize
profit and reduce loss to the lowest minimum.

Furthermore, I will be attaching the questions I used to generate the SQL queries. Also, the dataset used for this project.
